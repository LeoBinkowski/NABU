This is the official Source Code to NABU ALPHABLAST

of the NABU Network of Ottawa Canada, 1982-1984

## How to build

Requires:
- Microsoft MACRO-80 Assembler for CP/M (M80.COM)
- Microsoft FORTRAN-80 for CP/M (F80.COM)
- Microsoft LINK-80 Linker for CP/M (L80.COM)
- NABU CABUILD.COM utility (changes a CP/M .COM file into a NABU .PAK segment file)

on a CP/M 2.2 or CP/M 3.0 drive where the files in this folder have been copied.

To build the example:

`SUBMIT DOALL.SUB`

This results in an ALPHA.COM file, which can be converted using CABUILD.COM to software loadable on a NABU PC.
