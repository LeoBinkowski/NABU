
     DOCUMENTATION OF FILES WRITTEN FOR MINER 2049er by J. Fernandez
     ===============================================================

     INTRODUCTION
     ------------

          The  game  MINER  2049er was basically written  in  two 
     parts.   Leo Binkowski wrote the "Bounty Bob" portion and JF 
     wrote  the "Map" portion.   Following is approximately  what 
     the two parts entailed:

          BOUNTY BOB
               - Logic  of Bounty Bob as he moves through  screen 
               (moving on catwalks,  slides, transporters, moving 
               platforms,   lift,   cannon,   jumping,   falling, 
               becoming  radioactive,   dieing).    Also  dynamic 
               special effects such as moving platforms, lift and 
               cannon.   All  sound is managed from this  module.  
               Additionally, integration of actual game into Nabu 
               standard shell,  opening screen,  help,  etc.,  is 
               done here.

          MAP
               - Basically  concerned  with mapping  pictures  on 
               screens   such  as  catwalks,   slides,   ladders, 
               transporters, shacks, and tables for all of these.  
               Also monster logic,  radioactive pulverizers,  and 
               some  static special effects such  as  transporter 
               colors,   radioactive  martini,   and  radioactive 
               waste.   Additionally,  scoring  is taken care of, 
               including timer.

          The following documentation refers to the Map Module as 
     written by JF.   Functionally,  a library was created of the 
     Map  files (JLIB.REL) and a library of the Bounty Bob  files 
     (LEOLIB.REL).    Then  these  two  were  linked  to   create 
     MINER.COM.

          A note on conditional compiles (CCP) used in Map: Since 
     the  game was written in two parts it was necessary to  test 
     each independently.  Conditional compiles were used to allow 
     the  possibility  of using the same routines both  with  and 
     without the Bounty Bob module.   Care must be taken that the 
     files  that use the conditional compiles have the equate CCP 
     set to the proper value upon compilation.  The following use 
     conditional  compiles  and  may  be  batch  compiled   using 
     CCPM.SUB :
          
          ADSCOR.MAC

          MONTSK.MAC

          JFMON.MAC

          TIME.MAC

          MAP.MAC

          To  link the Map module for testing (stand alone),  use 
     L.SUB,  which will create MAP.COM,  without BB.   To  create 
     JLIB.REL  use JL.SUB.   To create MINER.COM,  insert a  disk 
     with  LEOLIB.REL in drive B and use MIN.SUB with JLIB.REL in 
     drive A.

     ACTADD              Does  actual adding of register pair  BC 
                         to score.

     BONTSK              Times the updating of the bonus points.

     COPSCO              Copies  player score and extra man  flag 
                         to working buffers.

     DISCOR              Updates   the   standard  ASCII   scores 
                         (including   high   score).     Prepares 
                         buffers and sets flag for SCORUP.

     FREMAN              Gives  present player extra man if score 
                         reaches  10,000.   It also attaches  the 
                         extra man task (XMATSK) and  initializes 
                         the sound for it.

     INISCO              Initializes all score parameters for the 
                         beginning of a game.

     SCOCOP              Copies working score and extra man  flag 
                         to player's score and flag.

     SCOTSK              Takes  care of calling SCORUN to put  up 
                         score whenever it is updated.   If score 
                         is not updated after a given delay, then 
                         the score flashing is regulated.

     TIMBON              Updates  the  bonus points  when  screen 
                         successfully completed.

     XMATSK              Flashes  screen  back-ground  blue/black 
                         when extra man score is reached.

     CONTENTS OF DOSCR.MAC
     =====================
     
          This  file contains the routines that create the screen 
     pictures  by reading the appropriate table entries as  build 
     by SCREENS.MAC.   For each picture, the appropriate table is 
     updated.   Basically  the  routine DOSCR loops  through  the 
     entries  and creates whatever picture is  encoded.   Then  a 
     routine  is  called that sets up the table entry  parameters 
     and calls the routine from CATMAP.MAC that actually  updates 
     the table entry.

                         with   BB,   sets  flag  if  BB  becomes 
                         radioactive due to collision or destroys 
                         monster  and  flashes score value if  BB

     CONTENTS OF MONTSK.MAC
     ======================
     
          This file contains the monster task as well as routines 
     relating  to  some  of  the  special  effects  such  as  the 
     radiactive martini,  waste, and pulverizers (plungers).  The 
     actual routine that moves the monsters was split off and may 
     now be found in JFMON.MAC.

     SUBROUTINES         DESCRIPTION
     -----------         -----------

     ADDOFF              Used by PLUPIC and PDOCOL to add offsets 
                         of plunger locations to pattern or color 
                         tables.

     ADDTON              Does  addition of TONNAGE for Station 10 
                         and sets flags for display of amount and 
                         for  DANGER message if TONNAGE  is  over 
                         30.

     CKCOLL              Used   by  various  routines  to   check

                         object.

     CKLIM               Checks   BB  collision  with  limits  in

                         walls  and roofs) or invisible (sides of 
                         the screen).

     DODANG              Takes  care of displaying DANGER message 
                         for Station 10.

                         to  make  martini  look  radiactive   in 
                         Station 5.

     MONTSK              Monster task checks collision between BB

                         to  erase  treasures,  put  up  treasure 
                         values and erase treasure values.  Takes 
                         care of monster colors and flashing when 
                         required.   Calls  JFMON which does  the 
                         checking    of   monsters   and    their 
                         movements.

     PDOCOL              Puts  up the appropriate color  for  the 
                         plungers to make them look radioactive.

                         colors.  Calls PDOCOL.

                         coordinates.

     PLUTSK              Plunger  task.   Calls routines to  move 
                         plungers,  change their colors and check 
                         collision with BB.

     PUTPLU              Creates  the initial plungers and  calls 
                         PLUENT to create the tables.

     PUTWAS              Initializes radioctive waste.

     -----------         -----------

     TASK1               Used  to test MAP without BB module.   A 
                         fake  BB  is created and allowed  to  be

     DOSCR  to build each of the 10 possible screens.   The table 
     is therefore divided into 10 sections, one for each Station.  
     Each entry of this table is input by the use of a macro.
