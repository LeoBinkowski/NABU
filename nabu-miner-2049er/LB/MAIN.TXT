THIS IS THE DOCUMENTATION FOR THE STANDARD SHELL

THE MAINLINE IS IN THE MODULE 'MAIN'

1.   IT CALLS 'SETUP' TO SETUP THE BASE ADDRESSES,FILL VRAM WILL 0,
ENABLE  TASKS,SET GRAPHICS MODE 1,VBLANKOFF,FILL SCREEN WILL  20H 
ETC.
2.   IT  CALLS  'ANIMATE' FOR YOUR ANIMATION - YOU  LOAD  IN  ANY 
GRAPHICS TABLES, SET ANY VARIABLES ETC.
3.   IT  THEN  CALLS  'OPEN' TO DO THE OPENING SCREEN  AND  HELP 
SCREENS
     - ALL  HELP  SCREENS  MUST USE DEFMSG AND  MUST  HAVE  LOCAL 
       LABELS
     - ALL LOCAL LABELS MUST BE DEFINED IN A MESSAGE BLOCK
       WITH A BEGIN AND AN END ADDRESS
     - ALL MESSAGE BLOCKS MUST BE DEFINED IN THE FORMAT AS SHOWN
          DW   FIRST  ADDRESS OF MESSAGE  BLOCK,LAST  ADDRESS  OF 
               MESSAGE BLOCK
          DW   FIRST ADDRESS OF SECOND MESSAGE BLOCK,LAST ADDRESS
               OF SECOND MESSAGE BLOCK
          .
          .
          .
          DW   FIRST ADDRESS OF LAST MESSAGE BLOCK,LAST ADDRESS
               OF LAST MESSAGE BLOCK     
     - NOTE: I EXPECT NO TASKS TO BE RUNNING WHEN THIS ROUTINE
             IS RUNNING AND I HAVE MY OWN SPECIAL KEYBOARD AND 
             JOYSTICK CHECKING CHECKING ROUTINE THAT POPS THE 
             STACK ON RESTART
     -IN THE VERSION WITH OPTIONS I DO A JUMP TO THE OPTION
      SCREEN AND TO GET BACK YOU CAN EITHER DO A JUMP TO 
      'GAME' OR POP THE STACK WITH 'RET'
     -THE REASON FOR THIS IS SO YOU CAN USE 'GTKEY' FROM THE 
      INSTRUCTION SCREENS SAFELY
4.   IT CALLS 'GINIT' TO LOAD ALL THE GRAPHICS TABLE
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT TO HERE
5.   THEN IT CALLS 'INIT' TO INIALIZE ALL VARIABLES FOR A NEW
OR RESTARTED GAME 
     NOTE: I INIALIZE THE VARIABLES PFLAG,HFLAG,RFLAG FOR THE
           GAME, ANY OTHERS ARE NOT IMPORTANT
6.   NEXT IT CALLS 'GTASK' TO SET UP ALL TASKS. I HAVE SETUP
A KEYBOARD AND JOYSTICKING CHECKING TASK IF YOU WANT TO USE
THEM, HOWEVER THEY CAN EASILY BE REMOVED
7.   YOU SET 1 OF 3 FLAGS TO STOP THE GAME
          PFLAG: IS THE PLAY FLAG 1=GAME IN PLAG; 0 = END IF PLAY
          HFLAG: HELP FLAG 1 = HELP WANTED; 0 = NORMAL PLAY
          RFLAG: RESTART FLAG 1 = WANT TO RESTART; 0 =NORMAL PLAY
     I WILL SET THEM UP RIGHT IN 'INIT'
     NOTE: MY MAINLINE DOES NOTHING IT JUST WAITS
           AND JUMPS ACCORDINGLY
8.   IF END OF PLAY ALL TASKS ARE REMOVED IN 'RTASK'
9.   AND THEN 'ENDSCR' IS CALLED TO DISPLAY THE END SCREEN
     THE END SCREEN ROUTINE EXPECTS NO TASKS TO BE RUNNING
     AND DOES DIFFERENT KEYBOARD AND JOYSTICK CHECKING THAN
     THE INSTRUCTION SCREENS
     - PUT THE HIGH SCORE IN THE SIX BYTE BUFFER 'HSCORE' IN
       ASCII
     - PUT THE SCORE IN THE SIX BYTE BUFFER 'SCORE' IN ASCII
10.  THE ROUTINE 'REVERSE' REVERSES 13 CHARACTERS ON THE SCREEN
     IT EXPECTS THE PATTERN TABLE TO BE LOADED WITH MY FORM
     OF ENGLISH THAT HAS 2 COMPLETE CHARACTER SETS
     PASS 'REVERSE' AN X AND Y COOR, Y COOR MUST AT LEAST BE
     DOUBLE SPACED
     YOU SHOULD NOT FOOL AROUND WITH THIS ROUTINE
11.  TO LINK ALL FILES USE M2.SUB
     TO LIST ALL FILES USE MLIST.SUB
     TO ZSID COM FILE USE D.SUB


**NOTE:  WHEN  YOU  FIRST GET A COPY OF MY DISK IT WILL  RUN  OFF 
JOYSTICK 2, JUST LINK IT AND IT SHOULD RUN OFF JOYSTICK 1
